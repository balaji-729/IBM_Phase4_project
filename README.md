# DevOps Project: Improving Development Speed and Reducing Production Issues

## Overview
This project aims to optimize software development and deployment using DevOps best practices. It integrates automation, CI/CD, containerization, monitoring, and logging to enhance efficiency and reliability.

## Features
- **Containerized Application:** Runs as a Docker container for consistency across environments.
- **Automated Testing & CI/CD:** GitHub Actions & Jenkins ensure smooth integration and deployment.
- **Kubernetes Deployment:** Manages application scalability and availability.
- **Monitoring & Logging:** Prometheus and Grafana for tracking system health.

## Project Structure
Refer to the directory structure in this repository for an organized breakdown of components.

## Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/devops-project.git
   ```
2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd devops-project
   ```
3. Build and run the application using Docker:
   ```sh

   docker run -p 3000:3000 devops-app
   ```

## Deployment
### Kubernetes
1. Apply the Kubernetes configurations:
   ```sh
   kubectl apply -f kubernetes/
   ```
2. Verify the deployment:
   ```sh
   kubectl get pods
   ```

## CI/CD Pipeline
- **GitHub Actions:** Automatically builds, tests, and deploys on code push.
- **Jenkins:** Alternative pipeline for deployment automation.

## Monitoring
- **Prometheus:** Collects application metrics.
- **Grafana:** Visualizes real-time application performance.
